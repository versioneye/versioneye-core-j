# versioneye-core-j

This project contains the persistence and services for VersionEye implemented in Java. Just testing. 

## Start the backend services for VersionEye

This project contains a [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file which describes the backend services
of VersionEye. You can start the backend services like this:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

That will start:

 - MongoDB
 - RabbitMQ
 - ElasticSearch
 - Memcached

For persistence you should comment in and adjust the mount volumes in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
for MongoDB and ElasticSearch. If you are not interested in persisting the data on your host you can
let it untouched.

Shutting down the backend services works like this:

```
docker-compose down
```

## MongoDB Config

As primary database we are using MongoDB. To make this project work you need to configure
the MongoDB connection in `src/test/resources/mongo.properties`.
If you run MongoDB as a single instance, only fill out the first 3 lines.

## Tests

Run the tests like this:

```
mvn clean test
```

## Support
